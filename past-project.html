                <h2>Animal Shelter Intake Analysis Data Science Project</h2>
                <p>A favorite project that I've completed in a past class is an analysis of shelter intake data. This project was my final project for advanced data science, and used the concept of frequent pairs generated by an A-priori algorithm to determine if there were any combinations of characteristics that led to an animal being adopted or not. All the data analysis was done in Python.</p>
                <p>I used animal shelter data sourced from the city of Long Beach, California. The dataset can be accessed at on the <a href="https://data.longbeach.gov/explore/dataset/animal-shelter-intakes-and-outcomes">Long Beach Government's website</a> and is available for free download.</p>

                <h3>The Results</h3>
                <p>My exploration was to determine which traits led to a successful or unsuccessful outcome. Based on the analysis results, I found that an animal's sex and intake condition have the largest impact on the outcome type. An animal's sex, mostly being spayed or neutered versus being unfixed, and intake condition played the largest role in determining their outcome. Unfixed female and male cats, particularly those coming in at an underweight or underage condition, may have a lower chance of being adopted, while cats and dogs that are spayed or neutered, coming in with a normal condition, may have a higher chance of being adopted. </p>

                <h3>Importance</h3>
                <p>This project was one that was particularly meaningful to me due to the real world connections I was able to make, particularly to an area of interest in my personal life, which is something that I hadn't had the chance to do in many of my other coding classes. It was also my first time working with such a large dataset and designing my own analysis process on this data. I was able to find meaningful conclusions from the data, showing that intake condition does seem to play a role in the adoption outcome of a shelter animal, and thus it may often be out of the shelter's control whether the animal is able to be adopted or if the animal must be euthanized. However, it does seem that overall it would be beneficial to spay and neuter any animals that come into shelters in order to increase their chances of being adopted, something that with community support or donations could be made possible and implemented in many shelters.</p>
