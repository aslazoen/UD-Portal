                <p>Hi there! I'm Alyssa Lazoen, a senior in Computer Science at the University of Colorado Boulder. I have experience in full-stack software engineering, cloud computing, AI, and more. I look forward to being able to make universally accessible web pages that everyone can enjoy, and learning how to go beyond the bare basics of accessible design that I've been taught. I grew up in Michigan, and my family moved to Colorado in 2016. In my free time, I enjoy baking and cooking, as well as knitting and sewing. I also love animals, and want to adopt a cat in the near future.</p>

                <h2>Lab Reflections</h2>
                <h3>Lab #2</h3>
                <p>During lab 2, I learned the basics of using semantic HTML by developing a turtle wiki page. I discovered the proper HTML tags to use to define the different elements of my website, such as the nav, header, and figures. This allowed me to make a much better structured site that's easier to navigate using a screen reader. I was able to test out adding images along with captions and alternative text to make them accessible as well.</p>

                <h3>Lab #3</h3>
                <p>During lab 3, I was able to make use of a lot of new accessibility features designing a site for a restaurant. I learned how to implement a skip navigation button, accessible tables and forms, super specific semantic HTML, and make use of icons. I also experimented using a screen reader to navigate my website, which was definitely challenging, but I saw firsthand how helpful the accessibility features we included were in making it easier to understand.</p>

                <h3>Lab #4</h3>
                <p>During lab 4, I learned about how to make a webpage responsive for different screen sizes using a CSS grid, and implemented a design for a hotel's website. This allows me to design webpages that are accesible for phones, adjusting how the contents are displayed so they're easily visible and clickable on a small phone screen. Designing for mobile first is the best way to ensure your website looks good and works properly on all devices. While not implemented in this lab, I later also learned how to add a grid within the main content section, allowing even more flexibility in my layout.</p>
