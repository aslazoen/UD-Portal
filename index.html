                <p>Hi there! I'm Alyssa Lazoen, a senior in Computer Science at the University of Colorado Boulder. I have experience in full-stack software engineering, cloud computing, AI, and more. I look forward to being able to make universally accessible web pages that everyone can enjoy, and learning how to go beyond the bare basics of accessible design that I've been taught. I grew up in Michigan, and my family moved to Colorado in 2016. In my free time, I enjoy baking and cooking, as well as knitting and sewing. I also love animals, and want to adopt a cat in the near future.</p>
