                <p>
                    Universal design should meet the needs of as many people as possible. There can be many ways to approach universal design, and this page will help you narrow down the best ways to do it.

                <h3> Web Standards</h3>
                <p>
                    The W3C, founded in 1994 by Tim Berners-Lee, is an organization that seeks to standardize the protocols and technologies used by web designers in order to make the content available to as many people as possible. The W3C's goals prioritize accessibility, internationalization, privacy and security. Web standards can define the standard-compliant languages used for various website building purposes, such as the use of HTML for structure and CSS for style, to promote the development of web pages with syntax and code elements that can be recognized by a large range of browsers. Having web standards improves the accessibility of websites, as the uniform structure can be easier to navigate for those who use screen readers or keyboard navigation.
                </p>
                    
                <p>
                    However, along with following these standardizations, there are also a few principles that you can follow to ensure that you're designing the best site you can.

                    Another set of general design principles that can be applied to make your website intuitive for all users is Donald Norman's design principles. Norman's concepts are useful to keep in mind for designing anything, and can help you to begin thinking like a designer, but some definitions must be extended for users who don't have certain sensory capabilities.
