                <h2>Why Universal Design is important...</h2>
                <p>
                    Embracing universal design means making the web more easily accessible, understandable, and useable for <strong>everyone</strong>, no matter your situation. Universal design is the process of making meaningful decisions around how your website is structured, ensuring that it's optimized for aesthetics and usability.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Every person in the world has their own limitations in what they're able to navigate and understand on the web, and mindful design will benefit everyone. There are more internet users than ever these days, with people constantly needing to be on the web not only for communication or entertainment, but to complete school, work, and even government tasks on a daily basis. In a world so focused on the use of the internet, everyone should have the right and ability to access the web in a way that works for them and their own level of ability.

                <h3>An Aging Population</h3>
                <p>
                    Just in the United States, there are roughly 41.1 million people with disabilities, making up about 12.7% of the total population. The United States population, as well as populations around the world, are also aging. Those who don't have trouble navigating websites now very easily can have their mobility, hearing, sight, or more decline as they age. If your website is inaccessible, that's a lot of potential users that you could be losing.

                <h3>Benefits of Universal Design</h3>
                <p>
                    Universal design does not mean that you need to compromise, but in fact works in conjunction with creating a visually pleasing and appealing site that will also benefit you in many ways. A website designed with accessibility in mind makes it more approachable and appealing to all web users, so you're bound to gain and retain more visitors, avoiding frustrating someone to the point where they click off your site within seconds. Beyond retaining these users, search engines will often put accessibly designed websites at the tops of searches, meaning you'll also attract more views with a well-designed website.
